# Features

## Navigation Bar

- The site features a responsive Navigation Bar which includes links to Home, Exercises, About and Contact. 
- Although clicking the logo brings users Home, a dedicated Home link is included in the Navigation Bar in line with UX best practices. 
- Other than Home, links are ordered by importance - Exercises is the main content of the site that users will interact with and as such comes before the About and Contact links.
- The active page a user is on is visually highlighted to help orient the user as they navigate the site.

## Landing Content

- The landing page shows a visual illustration of a person in a yoga pose along with the large headline and a short paragraph of desriptive text - these elements immediately communicate the intent of the site.
- There are two CTAs on the landing page - the primary CTA ("Get started") links to the "Exercises" page and enables users to quickly engage with the site's content. The secondary CTA ("Learn more") links to the "About" page so users can read more about the site's purpose and intent.


# Testing

## Bugs

- During development, the site was tested on an iPhone XS Max to check responsiveness. It was noted that the Newletter Subscribe CTA and Contact Form CTA were not displaying the correct styling compared to the Chrome Dev Tools Inpector, and did not have the correct border radius. After further experimentation and testing, a solution was found on Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20640182/iphone-overriding-all-of-my-styles-on-an-inputtype-submit). The cause of the "bug" relates to how Safari on an iPhone renders <input type="submit"> and was fixed by adding "-webkit-appearance:none;" to the element's CSS rule.
