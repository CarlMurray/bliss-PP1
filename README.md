# Features

##Â Navigation Bar

The site features a responsive Navigation Bar which includes links to Home, Exercises, About and Contact. Although clicking the logo brings users Home, a dedicated Home link is included in the Navigation Bar in line with UX best practices. Other than Home, links are ordered by importance - Exercises is the main content of the site that users will interact with and as such comes before the About and Contact links.

The active page a user is on is visually highlighted to help orient the user as they navigate the site.
